'''
Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
'''

from typing import List


class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(0,len(nums)-1,3):
            if nums[i] != nums[i+1]:
                return nums[i]
        return nums[-1]
